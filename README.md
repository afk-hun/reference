# Hej, jag heter Ákos och välkommen 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious and enthusiastic software developer from Budapest.
In my last 5 and half years I was an important building block of my team, in the car industry.
But I realized that I want to do something differnt so I have started learning React.
I know, I do a very big change from a slow and left behind industry to the cutting edge technology.

## 💻 What the hack is ...

This repository try to introduce my current knowledge and experience about React development.
At the moment you have to checkout the main branch and use the good old `  npm i` `  npm start` commands in terminal.
