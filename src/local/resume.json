    "about_me": "I am a curious problem-solver, who likes to try himself in various roles. At the end of 2023 I started to redifining myself. I decided to make a big change and leave the navigation software industry to jump into web development. I am interested in learning everything about React and React-Native. Even in complex project I keep the customer’s satisfaction in focus. I do take roles in every part of the development porcess from ideation, development to operation. I like to work in a cheerful group setting, but it is important for me to take ownership of my tasks and give them my all. If you see a camera in my hand, don’t panic, it is my guilty pleasure. Capturing unique moment in my life helps me maintain my creative side.",
